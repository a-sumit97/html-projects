              Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July
              2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served
              as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
              raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
              engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
              science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
              Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
              Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
              civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.
              He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work
              on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
              technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical,
              and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
              the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
